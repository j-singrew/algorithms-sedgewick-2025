# algorithms-sedgewick-2025
My Java-based learning repository for Algorithms (4th Edition) by Robert Sedgewick. Includes implementations, notes, and exercises.

# Algorithms (4th Edition) â€“ Java Implementations

This repository contains my Java-based implementations and exercises from the book  
ðŸ“˜ **Algorithms (4th Edition)** by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures by:
- Writing clean, well-documented Java code
- Solving exercises and practical problems from the book
- Building a strong foundation in classic algorithms
