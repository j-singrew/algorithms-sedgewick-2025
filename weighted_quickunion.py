"""
It wants you to modify the Quick-Find union() method to use a weighted strategy:

Track the size of each component.

When merging two components, only change the IDs of the smaller component to the larger one.

After coding it, you should also analyze performance:

Compare how many array updates happen vs normal Quick-Find.

Explain why this improves efficiency (amortized O(log N) per union instead of O(N)).

So the exercise has two parts:

Implement the weighted Quick-Find algorithm in code.

Explain/observe the performance improvement.
